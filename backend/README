Backend implemented in python.

Requires: protobuf-compiler python-protobuf

1. Make sure the device and the computer the script is executed on
are in the same WLAN. Check if the /data/cml/stunnel-client.conf and
/data/cml/device.conf on the device match the network situation at hand.
2. Setup the stunnel
	The makefile provides the target setup_stunnel which uses the config from
	the git repo. Adapt this config to the network situation at hand. Make sure
	that the paths to the cert, key and CA file are correct. The paths are
	relative to the folder that stunnel is started from. Also check that the ip
	addresses and ports match your network setup.
3. Run the testsuites using the targets from the makefile (test_basic, test_log,
test_wipe). If necessary adapt the ip addresses and ports the backend and the
file server should bind to by editing the makefile.

When testing the update function certain files need to be placed in the backend
folder. The files that need to be present and their directory structure is shown here:

        ├── a2os-version_number.cert
        ├── a2os-version_number.conf
        └── a2os-version_number.sig
In order to run the update tests, acquire the files from the developer team at
Fraunhofer AISEC.

When the files are in place, make sure that stunnel is setup correctly. Then
start the test with:
./backend.py 127.0.0.1 8000 127.0.0.1 8888 update --conf conf --sig sig --cert cert
Replace conf, sig and cert with the actual paths to the files. Do not exit the
testsuite until all downloads are finished by the device. When the device has
finished downloading, it will display a notification, instructing the user to
restart the device in order to install the updates.
